This repository is used for the exercises and projects associated the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalks (to know more about this, please see this article: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)

Though this is a guided bootcamp (zoomcamp? haha), all the relevant files and codes are written and implemented by me. :)
